# NameCase
Stop players from joining with a mistyped name


This plugin fixes the problem when a user tries to join using a mistyped name, which results in many problems with other plugins. It basically checks if their name matches with the name they first joined with. it also disallows users who are trying to join with illegal characters in their name

you NEED to have the sqlite drivers installed on your bungeecord server. bungeecord does NOT support sqlite by default.
You can add the drivers manually to your BungeeCord.jar or use this plugin which requires no installation -> https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/sqlite-for-bungeecord.57191/
